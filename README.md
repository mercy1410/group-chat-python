# group-chat-python
This is a Python-based real-time group chat application designed for multiple users (friends) to communicate securely. The project simulates a chat between 6 friends, where each user is identified by their roll number mapped to their name.

# The chat supports:
*Multiple clients connecting simultaneously to a single server
*AES encryption for secure message transmission
*Roll numbers mapped to names, making the chat user-friendly
*Console-based interface for quick testing

# Features
*Server-Client Architecture: One server manages all clients
*Threading: Allows simultaneous messaging without blocking
*Secure Messaging: Messages are encrypted using AES
*Easy Setup: Only one client file required; multiple instances simulate different users

# âœ… Perfect For
*Demonstrating networking and security concepts in Python
*Project portfolio or GitHub showcase
*Learning AES encryption, socket programming, and threading
